## Guide + code to run VDO.Ninja without Internet on a local network

This guide was tested on a Raspberry Pi with a clean RPI OS installed ([the image of which is provided if desired](https://github.com/steveseguin/offline_deployment#rpi-provided-image-option))

Included with this guide is a custom Node.js server script (express.js), along with a linux service file to auto-start things on boot, if needed. The Node.js script combines a webserver and websocket server in one.

This deployment and script is intended for offline use -- I haven't tested for public use. To use it online however, you'd need to specify a STUN and TURN in the `session.configuration` setttings, as STUN/TURN are not needed for offline use. Using a valid SSL certificate and a domain name would also probably be advised for online-use.

### Installing from scratch 

If installing via scratch, the following is a sample script that might get you going. I'd recommend you run each block manually, a bit at a time, to catch any errors or user input requirements along the way. This install script may run fine on a Ubuntu system, but it's only tested on a Raspberry Pi.

We will be using port 443 in the below steps, but you change to something else using, eg: `export PORT=8443`

```
### If using a Raspberry Pi, and if having issues updating
sudo chmod 777 /etc/resolv.conf
sudo echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" >> /etc/resolv.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/resolv.conf
sudo chattr -V +i /etc/resolv.conf ### lock access
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service
export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1

### Update
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

### Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install git -y
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
sudo apt-get install npm -y
sudo apt-get install vim -y

### Install vdo.ninja 
git clone https://github.com/steveseguin/vdo.ninja

## configure vdo.ninja for local hss server
sed -i 's/\/\/ session\.customWSS = true;/session\.wss = "wss:\/\/"+window\.location\.host;session\.customWSS = true;session\.salt = "vdo\.ninja";session.configuration = {}/' ./vdo.ninja/index.html

### Install websocket server
git clone https://github.com/steveseguin/offline_deployment
mv offline_deployment webserver
cd webserver
npm install
npm install express

## Lets create our self-signed certs
openssl req  -nodes -new -x509  -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
## Just press enter to skip past the questions at the end of the process

## Make it available to the website, so you can download it and install it
cp cert.pem ../vdo.ninja/cert.pem

## Customize the port, optionally
# export PORT=443 ## by default, it will use port 443, but 8443 is a good alternative

## create a service and start the server
sudo cp vdoninja.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable vdoninja
sudo systemctl restart vdoninja

## or start our server directly ..
# sudo nodejs server.js

## show IP addresses
ifconfig 

```

You can then load the site at https://192.168.XXX.YYY/ or whereever its loaded.  Accept any SSL concerns or what not (see https://github.com/steveseguin/vdo.ninja/blob/develop/install.md#dealing-with-no-ssl-scenarios for more details)

You may need to download and install the cert https://192.168.XXX.YYY/cert.pem if you don't have allowances for self-signed certs. The required cert is located at https://192.168.XXX.YYY/cert.pem for easy download.

### RPI provided image option

I'm providing a RPi image, but WiFi will need to be configured via boot config, Ethernet, or with keyboard/mouse. The image is a bit out of date at this point, but should still work I think. 

[Download it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10WtVXUh7yHxWmdSaR95-E_M3pnUNUtvr/view?usp=sharing) ( 2.4-GB zipped )

The image uses the following user/pass combo:
```
username: vdo 
password: ninja
```

It requires an 8-GB uSD card or larger; if it's too big, you'll need to PiShrink it down first using: https://ostechnix.com/pishrink-make-raspberry-pi-images-smaller/
(I may get around to doing that in the future)

Just burn the image following any RPi guide, login in, and get going.  Currently I think v22.10 (beta) is installed, so probably out of date. You can update, but if you do, you may need to run `sed -i 's/\/\/ session\.customWSS = true;/session\.wss = "wss:\/\/"+window\.location\.host;session\.customWSS = true;session\.salt = "vdo\.ninja";session.configuration = {}/' ./vdo.ninja/index.html` from the home user folder after, or manually update the index.html to point to the local wss server. Depending on how you update, it may not be needed though.

You can then load the site at https://192.168.XXX.YYY/ or whereever its loaded.  Accept any SSL concerns or what not (see https://github.com/steveseguin/vdo.ninja/blob/develop/install.md#dealing-with-no-ssl-scenarios for more details)

You may need to download and install the cert https://192.168.XXX.YYY/cert.pem if you don't have allowances for self-signed certs. The required cert is located at https://192.168.XXX.YYY/cert.pem for easy download.

### Docker option

There's now a docker option to deploy a basic offline-version of VDO.Ninja also, supplied by @hamza1311. Thank you.

#### How to use

1. Mount your certificates
2. Set environment variables `CERT_PATH` and `KEY_PATH` for the certificate and private key respectively
3. Bind port 8443
    3.1. **Note:** the port _can_ be different but you may run into issues where port is hardcoded to be 8443

#### Example

```
docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/certs,target=/var/certs -e KEY_PATH=/var/certs/private.key -e CERT_PATH=/var/certs/certificate.crt -p 8443:8443 vdoninja
```

### Getting OBS to play nice without Internet

If on Windows, OBS uses the same certificates as Chrome does, so adding self-signed certs to Chrome works for users there. There may be a URL parameter to disable SSL checking as well, but I can't seem to find it at the moment.

On Mac, I loosely recall that I needed to add the self-signed certs to the local system's keychain for it to work. 

@hamza1311 mentioned when deploying on Linux, to get OBS to play nice, they used real SSL certificates for their domain, and then had things point to their local IP in `/etc/hosts`.

Please let me know if you find additional ways to handle SSL certifcates offline, or other ways of ensureing webRTC plays nice.

### If you're having trouble ..

9 out of 10 times the issue you are having is with the SSL certificates. You need to install the certifcates used onto all the devices that interface with VDO.Ninja for it to work. This is not a simple task, so if you don't know what you are doing, I'd advise instead just getting a cellular hotspot or such, and not to self-deploy VDO.Ninja.

While there are some solutions that negate the need for self-signed certs, they can be even more complicated and convoluted.

If you don't know what a self-signed certificate is, it is not the same as having Let's Encrypt create one.

Let's Encrypt is a Certificate Authority (CA) that issues domain-validated SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates are recognized and trusted by most web browsers because Let's Encrypt is a member of the CA/Browser Forum and is included in the trusted root certificate stores of major web browsers and operating systems. Since we are deploying offline, we won't be using a CA issued certificate, but a self-signed one instead.

Self-signed certificates are not issued by a CA, but are created and signed by the entity or individual using the certificate. eg: `openssl req  -nodes -new -x509  -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`. Because they are not issued by a trusted CA, browsers and operating systems do not inherently trust self-signed certificates, often resulting in security warnings unless the certificate is manually added to the trust store of the device or application.

Because we want our self-signed cert to be trusted however, we will need to manually add the self-signed certificate to our trusted keychains; those used by our browsers and operating systems.  We will also be using the self-signed certificate for our locally hosted webserver and handshake (wss) server.

Please refer to your local chat bot for more information on create, using, and deploying self-signed certificates if this is all new to you.
